# Drizzle ORM 

This repository contains projects demonstraiting the use of Drizzle ORM, a modern TypeScript ORM, in different contexts:

1. Command-line interface (CLI) application built with Node.js and TypeScript, using postgres for the database
2. Express.js API, using postgres for the database
3. Todo app using Next.js App router, using Turso for the database


### Project 1: CLI application

The CLI application allows you to create, list, update, and delete user records from the command line.

[Here](https://github.com/Delvoid/drizzle-playground/tree/main/express) is the detailed README for the CLI application

### Project 2: Express.js API

The Express.js API allows you to create, list, update, and delete user records via HTTP requests.

[Here](https://github.com/Delvoid/drizzle-playground/tree/main/playground) is the detailed README for the Express.js API.

### Project 3: Next.js Todo App

The Next.js Todo App is a more complex project that combines Drizzle ORM with the Turso database and the Next.js framework. It includes basic CRUD operations, as well as filtering functionalities for managing todos.

This project shows how Drizzle ORM can be used in a real-world application scenario with a frontend framework.

[Here](https://github.com/Delvoid/drizzle-playground/tree/main/todo) is the detailed README for the Next.js Todo App.
